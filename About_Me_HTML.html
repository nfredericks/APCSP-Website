    <img src = "me1.png">
    <p class="p">I am an Eagle Scout, Lacrosse player, and a strong student at Piedmont High School. As a junior I am starting to research colleges and universities that I might be interested in attending. My interests are in math, business, and economics. So far my favorite schools are UC Santa Barbara, Santa Clara University, and Claremont McKenna. They are all very good schools, located in California. I am looking forward to college and expanding my horisons.</p>
